    "* all_combinations(self, without_distant_speaker=False): returns list (length 2951) of all miccell and spkrcell combinations: each combination is a tuple of tuples, eg. ``((2, 3, 3), (3, 0, 0))``.\n",

    "Important notes:\n",
    "1. travel_distance_over_surface() returns the lower bound of the echo's travel path; it assumes the surface's `z` value is `gir.dataset.grid.SURFACE_TOPZ`. The actual travel path is almost always longer than this. The upper bound on travel path can be determined using `gir.dataset.grid.SURFACE_BOTTOMZ` (see `create_db.ipynb` for an example of how to do this).\n",
